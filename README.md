This code was written by Caleb Kornfein for PhD candidate Janos Breuer at the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich during summer 2020. It analyzes models used in Mr. Breuer's research to predict the number of kilometers driven per year by different types of vehicles in various counties in Germany. In addition, I propose alternative ridge regression models that could have been used to tackle the problems. Ultimately, Mr. Breuer's models resulted in a published data set and were used in his future research as part of a transportation model estimating localized emissions of harmful pollutants.
